Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , I'm Haoxiang Sun (å­™æµ©ç¿”), a first-year undergraduate at [Turing Experimental Class](http://info.ruc.edu.cn/rcpy/bks/pyms/90f3e141aa5643ceb489b9a434ad50bc.htm) in [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn), majoring in Computer Science. With great interest in economics, I am also pursuing a minor in Finance at [Gaoli Experimental Class](http://gaoli.ruc.edu.cn/xspy/gljrkjsxw/index.htm) hosted by [Hillhouse Academy](https://www.globalhha.com/hhasite).

My current interests are in **large language models** (LLMs), particularly in enhancing their mathematical abilities. I'm also eager to dive deeper into **machine learning theory**, so I'm currently learning on topics such as the PAC learning framework, VC-Dimension, and so on.
